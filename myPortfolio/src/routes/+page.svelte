            I'm a 35 year old guy, who decided to switch day job out with the books during a pandemic. 
            I started learning c# last january, and I am currently a beginner in this language. 
            I got a couple of projects under the project tap, where you can see them on github. 
            There will come more projects on there as i make them. 
            I also started dabling in Zig and Unity. 
            This website was made with sveltekit.
